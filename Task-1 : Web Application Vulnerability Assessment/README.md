Web Application Vulnerability Assessment — OWASP Juice Shop

Student: Dev Suthar
Course / Assignment: Web App Vuln Assessment — News Headlines
Target: OWASP Juice Shop (local)
Date:= 14/9/2025

Objective

Perform a vulnerability assessment of an instance of OWASP Juice Shop and demonstrate exploits for: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication / password-reset flow. Provide screenshots as evidence and brief remediation steps.

Environment

Platform: Kali Linux (local VM or host)

Juice Shop: bkimminich/juice-shop:latest (Docker recommended)

Tools used: Burp Suite (Proxy, Repeater), Firefox, (optional: sqlmap)

Target URL: http://localhost:3000 (local instance)

How to run Juice Shop (quick)
# pull and run Juice Shop (Docker)
sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
sudo docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3000 --name juice bkimminich/juice-shop

# open in browser:
# http://localhost:3000

Summary of findings (short)

SQL Injection (High) — Login/search input was used to demonstrate SQLi behavior / login bypass. Evidence: screenshots/02_sqli_repeater.png.

Cross-Site Scripting — Reflected & Stored (High) — Payload executed (alert) when input was reflected or loaded from stored review. Evidence: screenshots/03_xss_alert.png.

Insecure authentication / password-reset (Medium-High) — Password reset / forgot-password flow leaked information or returned distinguishable responses allowing username enumeration / token visibility. Evidence: screenshots/04_reset_flow.png.

Target reachable — Juice Shop running locally. Evidence: screenshots/01_homepage.png.

Reproduction steps (very short, match screenshots)
SQL Injection (screenshot: 02_sqli_repeater.png)

Open Login page. Intercept request in Burp Proxy → send POST to Repeater.

Modify username field to: ' OR '1'='1' -- and send.

Observe response indicating bypass or SQL-related behavior. Capture Repeater request + response.

XSS (screenshot: 03_xss_alert.png)

In a text input (search or product review) submit: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

For reflected XSS — payload appears immediately in response (alert shows). For stored XSS — submit review, then load the product page and observe the alert. Capture browser alert + request in Burp.

Password reset / Auth issue (screenshot: 04_reset_flow.png)

Use "Forgot password" flow or test different usernames.

Inspect responses for token leakage, predictable token, or different error messages that show user existence (enumeration). Capture the request/response.

Remediation (high-level, copyable)

SQL Injection

Use parameterized queries / prepared statements (never string-concatenate SQL).

Use ORM or proper query parameterization (e.g., db.execute('SELECT ... WHERE id = ?', [id])).

Apply least-privilege DB user accounts.

XSS

Encode output according to context (HTML-encode, JS-encode, attribute-encode).

Use templating engines that auto-escape. Sanitize user inputs on server (e.g., sanitize-html) and implement CSP headers.

Authentication / Password Reset

Use cryptographically-secure, random, single-use, short-lived tokens for resets (e.g., crypto.randomBytes(32)), and store only hashed tokens server-side.

Enforce generic error messages (avoid "user not found" vs "wrong password").

Implement rate-limiting and account lockout for repeated failures.

Ensure all auth endpoints run over HTTPS and cookies use HttpOnly, Secure, and proper SameSite.

Validation notes

After patching, repeat the exact same requests used in the tests. The SQLi payload should not bypass auth or return extra data. XSS payloads should be sanitized/escaped and not execute. Reset flow should not leak tokens nor reveal user existence.

Commands & artifacts (for appendix)

Juice Shop docker start: sudo docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3000 --name juice bkimminich/juice-shop

Burp: Proxy → capture HTTP history → send vulnerable requests to Repeater → modify payloads → screenshot Repeater request/response.

Screenshot tool example: gnome-screenshot -a -f ~/juice_screenshots/02_sqli_repeater.png

Notes for grading

All tests were performed on a local Juice Shop instance (authorized target).

Screenshots show the request/response evidence and browser behavior required by the assignment.

Code-level remediation snippets and validation steps are included in the report (use this README as the summary; include more detail in your formal report if required).
